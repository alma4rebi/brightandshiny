Bright and Shiny
================

I wasn't happy with any of the color palettes that come with Inkscape, so I made my own.

Here's what it looks like:
![palette](/example/example.png)

If you want to use it in Inkscape, download the brightandshiny.gpl file and copy it to /home/yourname/.config/palettes (available only to you) or /usr/share/inkscape/palettes (available to all users).
